        <p class="questionText">This accessibility checklist is meant to help you determine how accessible your mobile application is. There are two sections to this questionnaire. The first section contains yes or no questions and the second section relies on your numerical values to compare two applications, of your choosing, to determine accessibility.</p>

        <p class="questionText">  Please answer every question on the home page within the questionnaire either yes, no or N/A. The N/A option is given, if the question doesn’t apply to your application.</p>
             
        <p class="questionText">  There is also a hints feature to give more information on each question. There is a question mark icon next to each question and to access the hint just hover over the icon.</p>
             
        <p class="questionText">   Your results will be generated and given both a percentage and scale representation of your application’s accessibility. To calculate the results, all your yes or no questions that were answered are going to be rated based on the importance that it has on making your application accessible. The numerical data will be calculated based on how it compares to the other application’s accessibility. All of this factors to the overall score of your application.</p>
               
        <p class="questionText">  Tips will also be given with the results to help improve your application’s accessibility. This questionnaire can be used repeatedly on an application to improve its accessibility.</p>
