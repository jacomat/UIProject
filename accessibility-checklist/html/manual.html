            The Website Accessibility Checklist (WAC) was created to help its users determine how 
            accessible a website is. Users start by answering questions about their target website 
            in a questionnaire. Each question has three possible answers: yes, no, and n/a. Users 
            can get hints about how to answer each question by hovering over the large question marks 
            at the end of each question. There are two buttons at the bottom of the questionnaire that 
            can be used to control it: the clear button and the submit button. When users select the 
            clear button, all answers on the questionnaire will be reset to n/a. When users select the 
            submit button, they will be redirected to a results page where they will be presented with 
            the target websiteâ€™s accessibility score, accessibility rank, and tips for improving accessibility. 
            These results are calculated using yes and no answers and their associated weight; n/a answers are 
            ignored. There are home buttons at the bottoms of this page and the result page that will redirect 
            the user to the home page containing the questionnaire when selected. There are help manual buttons 
            at the top right corners of the home and result pages that redirect the user to this page when selected.
